 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% boxedeps.cfg DOCUMENTATION

   %%% INSTALLATION: 
    %% (1)  Uncomment the line that corresponds to the 
    %% dvi-to-postscript printer driver that you use
    %% and comment out any other such lines.
    %% (2)  Place the modified file in one of your "TeX inputs" 
    %% directories.  An end-user might put it alongside
    %% his TeX files.  A system operator might put it 
    %% in a read-only directory.
    %% 
   %%% USE: 
    %% Place a command \input boxedeps.cfg in 
    %% style file for your .tex typescript.
    %% Or in its header.
    %% Then no command \Set<driver>EPSFSpecial is needed,
    %% and as a consequence, the .tex typescript is
    %% perfectly portable between sites that that are equipped 
    %% with boxedeps.tex and this configuration file.
    %% Highly recommended for all typescripts that
    %% use several drivers, say at home, at the office,
    %% on visit etc.

    %% NB: If you give a \Set<driver>EPSFSpecial 
    %% after this file has been input
    %% it will overrule this configuration file.
    %% Watch the log file for sign of this;
    %% it can trip you up!  But it can also be convenient.
