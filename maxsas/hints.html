<p>Stability Check of the Solution</p>
<p>In the example case above, a second analysis of the test distribution
was made to check the stability of the solution.  This is a very good
suggestion and is a must before you should present any data which you
have analyzed.  The stability check is made after a successful
solution has been obtained by re-analyzing with no parameters changed
except for the experimental background which the program suggests.  If
the answer is to be believed, the Stability Check should complete with
a comparable number of iterations and determine a comparable
background, volume fraction, and size distribution.</p>
<p>Getting the Background Close</p>
<p>It seems that there is a narrow thread on which the program may obtain
a reasonable analysis (within 20 iterations).  That thread has two
adjustable parameters: error scaling and constant background.  With a
larger error scaling term, the exact value of the background is less
important.  If one is not certain of the background level (and some of
the particle form models require a background different even from the
experimental background), it can be very difficult to guess within the
10% or so required with an error scaling factor of unity.</p>
<p>An algorithm that seems to navigate that thread to an acceptable
solution of a size distribution from a set of intensity data is as
follows: Decide upon the aspect ratio and the largest range of
dimensions that may exist in the data.  Run the analysis, choosing all
the data that you think will fit the model well.  Specify the contrast
if you know it.  Increase the errors by a factor of 5.0 (or maybe 10.
if conditions suggest).  Take a guess at the background (the
zero-order guess is zero).  Let the MaxEnt routine try to solve the
puzzle.  If it does not converge within 20 iterations, increase the
error scaling factor by double.  Keep doing this until the MaxEnt
routine says it has a &#8220;solution&#8221;.  Good!  We are not interested in
this solution because the residuals probably look like a smooth, curved
function.  What we are trying to do is get the program to tell us what
it &#8220;thinks&#8221; the background should be. Now that the program has
suggested a background to us, try analyzing again with this background
and a slightly decreased error scaling factor.  Now we are on the
&#8220;thread&#8221;.  Keep bringing the error scaling factor down (I know this
takes time) until you can be satisfied that the errors are
well-specified or that there is some systematic reason why the model
does not fit the data well. Whatever the background ends up as when
you are satisfied with the error scaling factor, accept it and
reanalyze the data again, leaving out any intensities that would be
below that background.</p>
<p>The background suggested by the program is based on a
statistically-weighted average of the difference between the intensity
calculated from the distribution (^I) and the input intensity data(I).
The exact equation looks like, where &#8220;s&#8221; are the input errors:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>NewBkg = Bkg + AVERAGE( (I - ^I) / s**2 )
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>FAILURES</p>
<p>In ideal circumstances when the program is iterating successfully the
user will observe the value of ChiSquared diminishing until it closely
approaches its final target value, which is the total number of data
points being used. Then in the final few iterations the entropy, which
had been steadily decreasing, will be seen to increase. The residuals
will become more randomly distributed with each iteration (a sign of a
good fit to the data) and the size distribution will slowly converge
to its final form. The program will then exit from the fitting
routine. This is the behaviour observed when the program is run using
the example data set.</p>
<p>It is quite possible for the fitting routine to fail to converge at
the first attempt. If this happens the program will return to the
calling routine after it has completed the maximum number of
iterations specified in the input section above and display the
following message:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>No convergence! # iter. = &quot;MaxIter&quot;
File was: &quot;InFile&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The program will then return to the input section to begin
a new analysis.</p>
<p>There are a number of problems which can arise.  Some of these are
annoying bugs in the program which are gradually being sorted out.
The usual symptoms of trouble are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>the program suddenly suffers &#8216;divide&#8217; or &#8216;square-root&#8217;</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">execution errors</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>it gets caught in a perpetual loop</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">(Hopefully, these errors have been trapped or corrected.
The bulk of them are from passing a literal variable as
a parameter to a subroutine or function. The size of the
argument is implied by the caller but actually
specified, sometimes differently, by the called
subroutine or function.  The error is then, &#8220;passing the
wrong size argument on the stack&#8221; which has been
corrected by setting a variable, of known size, to the
value of the literal and then passing the variable.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following remedies should be considered:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>take out points at either end of the data to change the program&#8217;s</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">calculation trajectory</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">change the size range or number of bins to have the same effect</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>consider that ChiSquared is being pushed too hard so the error</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">scaling can be increased and the point of tragedy is
never reached</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">adjust the constant background</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>re-assess the DISTRIBUTION of assigned errors on the input</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">data &#8211; Do they reflect the true scatter ?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">re-assess the particle form model with regard to the system</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>is the scattering just too weak or noisy for a respectable program</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">like this one ?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Considerations (1)-(3) should resolve matters if you have encountered
one of the program bugs; if not, then (4)-(7) may apply.  In most
situations, time spent adjusting the flat background seems to give the
best return on effort expended.  However it is worth considering a few
points relevant to (6) above.  The basic assumption is that the
scattering system comprises a DILUTE assembly of identically shaped
scattering particles, all of one kind, suspended in a uniform medium
or matrix.  Inter-particle interferences due to close packing at high
concentrations are not presently considered.  (J.E. Epperson is trying
to develop methods for treating these.) Such inter-particle
interferences are likely to result in run-failures or fictitious size
distributions.  A disordered interconnecting scattering interface
within the sample may also lead to spurious results.  Also the aspect
ratio, cannot be determined from SAS data alone: if a size
distribution can be obtained with one value, then size distributions
should be equally obtainable over all realistic values for a given
scattering particle type.  Thus both the choice of shape function and
the aspect ratio should be determined from independent methods such as
electron microscopy, theoretical models etc.</p>
<p>ERROR SCALING</p>
<p>The most likely reason is that the quoted errors are too small to
allow a close fit to the data by an algorithm that uses the ChiSquared
test as its consistency criterion.  This would probably be the case
if, during the iterations, the user observed chi-squared
asymptotically approaching a final value larger than the number of
data points being used, the residuals becoming randomly distributed
and the size distribution converging to a well behaved final form
(that is to say, one that extends over more than one histogram bin, is
not wildly oscillatory, and is small at either end of the diameter
range).  Should this occur, the easiest way to rectify it is to
specify an error scaling factor that is greater than unity. An
under-estimate of this factor is provided by the smallest value of
SQRT(ChiSquared/N) ever achieved by the program.  A reasonable error
scaling factor would then be, say, 1.1 times this estimate.  The user
should note, however, that this device should not be abused; if the
rescaled errors are much larger than their true values then
statistically significant information from the scattering pattern is
being thrown away.  Any size distribution is consistent with data of
infinite errors!</p>
<p>CONSTANT BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Another likely cause of a convergence failure is an incorrect constant
background subtraction.  If during the previous iterations the user
observed a large spike (that was not expected or predicted) at the low
diameter end of the size distribution then it is quite possible that
there is a constant background remaining in the data (the program is
interpreting the uniform intensity as the scattering from very small
particles).  Conversely, if the size distribution is unreasonably
biased towards large particles then it is possible that too much
background has been removed and the data is missing information about
the smallest particles in the sample.  In either of these cases the
user should specify a different amount of background.  The user is
reminded that of all the input parameters, the constant background
subtraction is the one that needs to be known most accurately (indeed,
if this parameter is inaccurate by more than about 10% then the
program will probably fail).  So any length of time the user spends on
a precise evaluation of the constant background is probably well
spent.</p>
<p>OTHER PARAMETERS</p>
<p>From a study of the size distributions plotted during the iterations
the user may be able to adjust some other input parameters in order to
accelerate convergence.  It might, for example, be clear that the
first estimate of a maximum particle diameter was too large or too
small (although if it was very far out in either direction the program
would have crashed rather than simply failed to converge).  And it
might become clear that the size distribution can be adequately
described by a histogram containing fewer bins than was originally
thought.  Judicious removal of some particularly doubtful data points
(for example those which differ in magnitude from their neighbours by
an extent far greater than their errors would suggest) is also
possible, though this is unlikely to have a great effect on the
convergence rate.</p>
<p>Precisely what to do in any particular case of convergence failure
depends on experience of the program which can only be gained by
experimenting with it.  Prospective users, once they have analyzed the
BIMODAL.SAS data set are urged to re-analyze it using different
combinations of diameter range, number of histogram bins, Q-vector
range, aspect ratio, error scaling, and constant background (both
positive and negative) to see how these variations affect the
execution of the program and the final volume fraction distributions
that the program produces (if it produces any).  The user should then
be able to recognize when and why the program is failing in any
particular fitting attempt and be able to eliminate the cause.</p>
