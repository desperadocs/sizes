Documentation of the Python version of `sizes`
===============================================

The Python version of the `sizes` program (for size distribution
analysis of small-angle scattering data using the maximum
entropy method of Skilling and Bryan) is under construction.
Not all features of the C and FORTRAN versions of the code are yet available.

The documentation for this version is rudimentary, as well.

The manual for the FORTRAN version is available: 
:download:`guide.pdf <../archive/guide.pdf>` as well as a previous version
of the FORTRAN documentation in the section here titled:
:ref:`maxsas_userguide`.
