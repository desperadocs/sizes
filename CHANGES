Previously
----------------------------------------

This progam was written in BASIC by GJ Daniell and later
translated into FORTRAN and adapted for SANS analysis.  It
has been further modified by AJ Allen to allow use with a
choice of particle form factors for different shapes.  It
was then modified by PR Jemian to allow portability between
the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX and Apple Macintosh
computers.
